        "ScribeLens is my first Generative AI + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app, built to provide private, document-focused Q&A without relying on third-party chatbots. Users can upload PDFs, which are converted into embeddings and stored in a local vector store. When questions are asked, the system retrieves the most relevant passages and generates accurate, context-aware answers always grounded in the uploaded docs. With a Next.js App Router backend, OpenAI embeddings, and zero external storage (files are never saved, and embeddings are deleted permanently on request), ScribeLens ensures both speed and privacy. This project taught me the foundations of RAG systems, vector search, and ethical AI development.",
